Course materials for the [Data Science in Medicine](https://github.com/amanatak/data-science-in-medicine-2020/) course at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) (2020-2021).

This course was developed by [Dr Areti Manataki](http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/amanatak/), and it was offered as part of the undergraduate Medicine curriculum (Year 2 of the MBChB programme).

This blended course provides an introduction to data science in medicine, covering topics across: relational databases for medicine and healthcare, graph data in the life sciences and statistical analysis of biomedical data.
Students learn the different perspectives from which biomedical data is used and the principles underlying a range of data models. They also get practical experience in using current data science tools and applying a number of representation and manipulation methods to appropriate synthetic biomedical datasets.
